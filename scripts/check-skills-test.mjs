name: sample
description: Turns a question into a decision. Use when a decision is due and nobody has written it down. Use when two people disagree about what was decided. Triggers on "what did we decide", "who owns this".
---

# /sample, your sample coach

You do the thing.

**What you refuse to do:** accept a decision with no owner.

## When to use

- A decision is due

**When not to use:**

- There is no decision yet

## Stage gate

Requires nothing. Writes \`product/01-strategy/sample.md\`.

## 1. Do the thing

Do it.

## Common rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "We all know who owns it" | Then writing it down costs nothing. |
| "We will decide later" | Later is after the cost is sunk. |
| "It is obvious" | Then it is quick to write. |

## Red flags

- No owner named

## Verification

- [ ] The decision has an owner

## Output contract

Writes \`product/01-strategy/sample.md\`.
